    "The [BlackHoles@Home](http://blackholesathome.net/) project allows users to volunteer CPU time so a large number of binary black holes simulations can be performed. The objective is to create a large catalog of [gravitational waveforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave), which can be used by observatories such as [LIGO](https://www.ligo.org), [VIRGO](https://www.virgo-gw.eu), and, in the future, [LISA](https://lisa.nasa.gov) in order to infer what was the source of a detected gravitational wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "BlackHoles@Home is destined to run on the [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu) infrastructure (alongside [Einstein@Home](https://einsteinathome.org/) and [many other great projects](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/projects.php)), enabling anyone with a computer to contribute to the construction of the largest numerical relativity gravitational wave catalogs ever produced.\n",
