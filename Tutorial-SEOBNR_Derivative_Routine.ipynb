    "This notebook documents the symbolic partial derivative routine used to generate analytic derivatives of the [SEOBNRv3](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/lalsuite) Hamiltonian (documented [here](../Tutorial-SEOBNR_v3_Hamiltonian.ipynb)) and described in [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06346).  In general, this notebook takes as input a file of inter-dependent mathematical expressions (in SymPy syntax), a file listing the names of values within those expressions, and a file listing all variables with which to take partial derivatives of each expression.  The output is a text file containing the original expression and those for each partial derivative computation.  The intention is to perform CSE on these expressions to create efficient partial derivative code!"
