    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Using SymPy, NRPy+ is able to provide a lot of different functions out of the box, covering many different use cases. However, there are some more obscure functions that we can't access; we may also want to use a different method than the SymPy function uses or use data from multiple different points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Obscure functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Most functions that we may need to use (such as trigonometric or logarithmic functions) are already included in SymPy. However, there are myriad other types of functions that can show up in various problems, such as the dilogarithm function, which is needed for the [Split Monopole initial data in `GiRaFFE_NRPy`](Tutorial-GiRaFFEfood_NRPy-Split_Monopole.ipynb). In this case, we were able to use a preexisting library, but this is not necessary in general; it is just as possible to add a function that you have written yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code below first tells SymPy that `nrpyMyFunc` should be treated as a SymPy function. This name is what should be used in the python code. Then, a dictionary is imported from `outputC` so we can add an entry to it. The key for the entry should be identical to the function; the entry (`myFunc_Ccode` in the example below) should be identical to the name of the function in the C code."

    "### Changing functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, SymPy may have the function you need, by implemented in a way that is not ideal. This was the case when we wrote [Tutorial-Min_Max_and_Piecewise_Expressions](../Tutorial-Min_Max_and_Piecewise_Expressions.ipynb). The SymPy implementation `sp.Abs` assumed a complex input (even when we specified that the input was real), resulting in a function that was much more computationally expensive than it needed to be and introducing errors into the produced C code. We solved this by adding `nrpyAbs` to the dictionary, pointing to basic C implementation of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple gridpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations like interpolation are critical to some applications (`GiRaFFE_NRPy` in particular depends on interpolation for its staggered grids). However, the only context in which data is read from multiple gridpoints in NRPy+ is finite-difference derivatives. "
